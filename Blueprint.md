These documents should guide developers and users alike through the projectâ€™s structure and setup. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or additional details!


Development Options

    Without Docker:
    Run the backend and frontend as described in the "Local Setup Without Docker" section.
    With Docker (Development Mode):
    Use docker-compose up --build to start all services in containers.
    This will automatically rebuild the backend and frontend images if changes are detected.

    With Docker (Production Mode):
    Use docker-compose up --build to start all services in containers.
    This will use the latest images from the Dockerfile.
    
Future Enhancements

    Authentication Improvements:
    Implement JWT-based authentication and secure API endpoints.
    Expanded Partner/Admin Dashboards:
    Enhance UI/UX and add role-specific functionalities.
    Testing:
    Write unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend.
    Production Readiness:
    Prepare production Dockerfiles, environment variable management, and CI/CD pipelines.
